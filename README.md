# Techniques-in-algebraic-geometry

Here is a collection of notes on various techniques in algebraic geometry. Initiated Mar 28, 2023.

[001]: Bend and break of a ramified cover Y->X of curves, with prescribed ramification. The technique comes from the paper "Every Rationally Connected Variety over the Function Field of a Curve Has a Rational Point." 

[002]: Poincare duality for cycles. Refined unramified cohomology allows one to use Poincare duality, that is a priori not available within the framework of algebraic cycles.

[003]: Degneration of surfaces. To essentially every way of describing a surface, there corresponds to a method of producing degenerations. We will briefly indicate the most typical examples. The techniques come from Ulf Persson "On degeneration of algebraic surfaces."

[004]: Coniveau. The coniveau filtration gives a filtration on Chow group, interpolating between algebraica and homological equivalence. Schreieder characterized codim-i cycles having coniveau 1 by liftibility of the Griffith's Abel-Jacobi invariant.

[005]: Borel-Moore cohomologies: We review classical definitions from topology and that used in refined unramified cohomology theory.

[006]: The warm-up example. We identify the torsion cokernel of cl^2 with Quotient of unramified cohomology groups.
